# Velane — The Trust Layer the Programmable World Can’t Live Without

Velane turns any action into an immutable, verifiable proof. No manipulation. No excuses. Just trust you can rely on.

---

## Demo
[shardvell.com](https://shardvell.com)  
Connect a wallet, hit **"Create Proof"**, and watch the runtime action mint an on-chain token with its cryptographic fingerprint.

---

## How It Works
1. **Action** — Any user or system operation.
2. **Proof** — Runtime generates a cryptographic hash.
3. **Verification** — Backend confirms integrity.
4. **Anchor** — Mint a compressed token with the proof on-chain.
5. **Validate** — Anyone can verify the action later.

---

## Why Compressed Accounts
Compressed tokens store proofs **efficiently and securely**.  
Scale to thousands of actions without killing your budget. Full Solana performance, fully composable.

## Built For
- dApps that need verifiable runtime integrity  
- Protocols that demand proof of action  
- Financial systems, compliance, governance
